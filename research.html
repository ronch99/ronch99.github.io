      I always reflect on the following big questions to guide myself:
      <ul>
        <li>How do humans <strong>generate and communicate</strong> with languages as a social being? What is the underlying <strong>human cognitive process</strong>?</li>
        <li>How can computers <strong>mimic</strong> such generation and social communication like human <strong>mathematically</strong>? How can computers <strong>interact and collaborate</strong> with humans like a social being?</li>
      </ul>
      Towards the boundary of these questions, my current research is focusing on:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Semantic parsing</strong>: translating human questions to SQL queries for smarter question answering</li>
        <li><strong>Dialogue systems</strong>: details coming soon...</li>
      </ul><br>

        <strong>Counts and Measurements in Scientific Texts</strong><br>
        <a href="img/attn_map.png"><img class="displayed" src="img/attn_map.png" style="float:left"></a>
        While the current literature has been focusing on language modeling with large pretrained architechtures, numeracy in texts has not received enough attention. 
        However, the ability to understand semantics of numbers with various numerations is critical for certain NLP tasks, especially those closely connected with scientific and medical texts. <br>
        <br>
        In this project, we are investigating the newly released dataset on counts and measurements at SemEval 2021 Task 8. 
        We plan to conduct data analysis for frequent features and patterns within the dataset and build deep learning models to solve the proposed recognition task. <br>

        Thanks very much to their financial aids, I have completed many hands-on programming projects to receive those course certifications on Coursera. So far, I have implemented various machine learning models, such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and principal component analysis, in MATLAB [<a href="https://github.com/ronch99/Coursera/tree/master/MLAndrewNg">Sample coursework</a>]. 
        Additionally, I turned most of the fundamental mathematics behind these models, represented by gradients, chain rules, and linear algebra computations, into source code with Python Numpy [<a href="file/MfML.pdf">Certification_MfML</a>]. 
        I also played around with several useful Python packages for Data Science, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Sk-learn, NLTK, and NetworkX [<a href="file/ADS.pdf">Certification_ADS</a>]. 
        Currently, I am working on Deep Neural Networks with Numpy and Tensorflow in the Deep Learning specialization.
