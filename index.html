          <br />

          I am a Ph.D. student at
          <a href="https://u.osu.edu/ihudas/people/">OSU SunLab</a> advised by
          Prof. <a href="http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~sun.397/">Huan Sun</a>.
          My research focuses on <i>Natural Language Processing</i>,
          <i>Conversational AI</i>, and <i>Human-Computer Interaction</i>. I'm
          currently interested in:<br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong> Interactive Language Agents</strong>: Large langauge
              models (LLMs) have achieved astonishing results in various tasks.
              I'm particularly interested in buiding language agents with LLMs
              that can autonomously plan for their tasks, refine their answers,
              and memorize task-specific knowledge. Moreover, I value the
              human-centered nature of language agents: although they excel at
              instruction following, how can we enable them to proactively
              collaborate with human users to make decisions? When would users
              prefer such agents over other mature (e.g. GUI-based) tools for their
              tasks, such as database browsing and web navigation?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Continual Learning</strong>: The development of language
              agents is never a one-time effort. After the initial depolyment,
              how can we teach models to solve new problems via trial-and-error
              and learn from their mistakes like humans? How to adapt models to
              novel language uses, especially those not covered in the training
              corpus? How to turn general agents into more personalized
              assistants according to the users' preference?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reliability and Explainability</strong>: While LLMs are
              powerful, they also make silly mistakes here and there. How can we
              enable models to better calibrate their predictions and explain
              them in natural language? How to prevent LLMs from giving undesired
              responses (e.g. misinformation, hallucination, social bias)?
            </li>
          </ul>
          I am also interested in human languages themselves and philosophy. So
          far, I can speak Chinese, English, Japanese (JLPT N2), and some
          elementary Korean. My favorite quote is “Cogito, ergo sum.” (or in
          English, “I think. Therefore, I am.”) by René Descartes.

        While the current literature has been focusing on language modeling with
        large pretrained architechtures, numeracy in texts has not received
        enough attention. However, the ability to understand semantics of
        numbers with various numerations is critical for certain NLP tasks,
        especially those closely connected with scientific and medical texts.

        <br />
        In this project, we are investigating the newly released dataset on
        counts and measurements at SemEval 2021 Task 8. We plan to conduct data
        analysis for frequent features and patterns within the dataset and build
        deep learning models to solve the proposed recognition task. <br />

        Thanks very much to their financial aids, I have completed many hands-on
        programming projects to receive those course certifications on Coursera.
        So far, I have implemented various machine learning models, such as
        linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and principal
        component analysis, in MATLAB [<a
          href="https://github.com/ronch99/Coursera/tree/master/MLAndrewNg"
          >Sample coursework</a
        >]. Additionally, I turned most of the fundamental mathematics behind
        these models, represented by gradients, chain rules, and linear algebra
        computations, into source code with Python Numpy [<a
          href="file/MfML.pdf"
          >Certification_MfML</a
        >]. I also played around with several useful Python packages for Data
        Science, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Sk-learn, NLTK, and NetworkX [<a
          href="file/ADS.pdf"
          >Certification_ADS</a
        >]. Currently, I am working on Deep Neural Networks with Numpy and
        Tensorflow in the Deep Learning specialization.
