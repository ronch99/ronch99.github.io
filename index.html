          <br />
          I am an undergraduate student at The Ohio State University, pursuing a
          major in
          <strong> Computer and Information Science </strong> and a minor in
          Math. Moreover, I am
          <strong>researching Natural Language Processing</strong> at
          <a href="https://u.osu.edu/ihudas/people/">SunLab</a> with Prof.
          <a href="http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~sun.397/">Huan Sun</a>.
          Recently, I received the
          <strong>CIS Undrgrad Scholarship</strong> from OSU CSE department. In
          summer 2021, I also interned at Prof.
          <a
            href="https://en.westlake.edu.cn/academics/School_of_Engineering/Research/iisec/Our_Faculty/201912/t20191211_2541.shtml"
            >Zhenzhong Lan</a
          >'s Deep Learning Lab. Before studying abroad at OSU, I obtained my
          high school degree from High School Affiliated to Fudan University. My
          resume is available <a href="file/Chen_Ziru.pdf">here</a>.
          <br /><br />
          My interests focus on
          <strong> Natural Language Processing</strong>,
          <strong>Conversational AI</strong>, and
          <strong>Computational Social Science</strong>. I research under the
          (strong) assumption "a Universal Turing Machine can simulate all
          cognitive activities" so that I may study human thoughts as algorithms
          and build computational models. I also value interdisciplinary
          insights from Linguistics, Psychology, Cognitive Science, etc.
          Besides, I am interested in natural languages themselves and
          philosophy. So far, I can speak Chinese, English, Japanese (JLPT N2),
          and some elementary Korean. In the future, I would love to have a
          taste of more European languages, such as Latin, since my favorite
          quote is in this language: <br />
          <div class="quote">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Cogito, ergo sum.” – René Descartes (Or, in
            English, “I think. Therefore, I am.”) <br />

          I am staying outside the U.S. due to the travel ban. Please allow
          <strong>a 24h period</strong> to hear back from me. But you are always
          welcome to remind me after this grace period. <br />

          Conversation is one of the most fundamental language usages and
          conveys various knowledge and information. By studying human
          conversations as data, I want to build better Conversational AI that
          effectively extracts and grounds social and professional knowledge to
          interact with humans:
          <br /><br />

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Extracting knowledge from conversations:</strong> <br />
              summarize informative conversational texts and learn social
              factors from conversations to make AI more human-like and
              user-friendly
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Grounding knowledge in conversations: </strong> <br />
              retrieve structured or unstructured knowledge in texts to generate
              contextualized dialogue responses and collaborate with humans
            </li>
          </ul>
          My current research is focusing on:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Semantic parsing</strong>: parsing human questions to SQL
              queries and retreive structured knowledge from databases
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dialogue systems</strong>: building robust dialogue
              systems for different ends (task-oriented bot, supportive chatbot,
              etc.)
            </li>

        While the current literature has been focusing on language modeling with
        large pretrained architechtures, numeracy in texts has not received
        enough attention. However, the ability to understand semantics of
        numbers with various numerations is critical for certain NLP tasks,
        especially those closely connected with scientific and medical texts.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this project, we are investigating the newly released dataset on
        counts and measurements at SemEval 2021 Task 8. We plan to conduct data
        analysis for frequent features and patterns within the dataset and build
        deep learning models to solve the proposed recognition task. <br />

        Thanks very much to their financial aids, I have completed many hands-on
        programming projects to receive those course certifications on Coursera.
        So far, I have implemented various machine learning models, such as
        linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and principal
        component analysis, in MATLAB [<a
          href="https://github.com/ronch99/Coursera/tree/master/MLAndrewNg"
          >Sample coursework</a
        >]. Additionally, I turned most of the fundamental mathematics behind
        these models, represented by gradients, chain rules, and linear algebra
        computations, into source code with Python Numpy [<a
          href="file/MfML.pdf"
          >Certification_MfML</a
        >]. I also played around with several useful Python packages for Data
        Science, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Sk-learn, NLTK, and NetworkX [<a
          href="file/ADS.pdf"
          >Certification_ADS</a
        >]. Currently, I am working on Deep Neural Networks with Numpy and
        Tensorflow in the Deep Learning specialization.
